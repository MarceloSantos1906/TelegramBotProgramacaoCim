# TelegramBotProgramacaoCim

<p>This is a small Telegram bot I'm developing at work to automate tasks such as checking for new work orders, printing work orders, and programming and sending them to specific teams.</p>

<br>

<h1>This is still in the development and testing phase. After I have a functional bot with everything I need, I will start rewriting the code to clean it up, improve performance, and enhance comprehension, making it easier for future maintenance.</h1>
